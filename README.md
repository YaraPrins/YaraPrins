👋 Hi, I’m Yara,

I'm a third year student for the study Communication & Multimedia Design on the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.
I am following a minor in Applied Game Design during the period of early February until late June.
I have a love for design as well as coding, and I'm a very eager learner.

I'm very enthusiastic, positive, social and a kind person and always in for a bit of banter.
Generally speaking though, I'm just a massive nerd. Besides coding and designing, I love playing Dungeons & Dragons, watching Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, playing games such as Assassins Creed, Portal, Life is Strange, The Last of Us and more.
I listen to a ton of different music, and I love going to concerts.
